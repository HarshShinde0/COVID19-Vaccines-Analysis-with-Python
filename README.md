## COVID-19 Country Vaccination Data Analysis

This code provides a comprehensive exploratory analysis of a global COVID-19 vaccination dataset. It demonstrates how to:

- **Load and inspect data**: Uses pandas to read the dataset, explore its structure, and generate descriptive statistics.
- **Data cleaning and filtering**: Removes UK regions (England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland) to avoid country-level duplication, and examines the distribution of vaccine types and countries.
- **Vaccine-country mapping**: Maps each unique vaccine combination to the set of countries using it, allowing for quick reference and comparison.
- **Data visualization**: Utilizes Plotly and Plotly Express to create a choropleth map, visually displaying the types of vaccines used by each country based on their ISO codes.

The code offers a foundation for further analysis, such as time trends or country-level comparisons, and is valuable for understanding global COVID-19 vaccination efforts.
